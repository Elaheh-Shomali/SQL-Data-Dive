# SQL Data Dive

Welcome to **SQL Data Dive** â€“ your repository for challenging yourself with SQL and honing your data exploration skills. This repository is designed to provide a hands-on approach to learning SQL, using real-world data and gradually increasing task complexity.

## Overview

SQL is a powerful tool that enables you to perform many functions at high efficiency and speed. With a syntax that aims to be logical from a human perspective, SQL allows you to explore and manipulate data stored in relational databases. In this repository, you'll find everything you need to start your SQL journey, from setting up your database to executing increasingly challenging queries.

## Repository Structure

- **1_database/**  
  Contains the `publications_dump.sql` file. This database dump includes:
  - **Database (Schema) Creation:** SQL statements to create the database.
  - **Table Definitions:** Create all the tables, defining columns, data types, and relationships (primary & foreign keys).
  - **Data Insertion:** Populate the tables with sample data.

- **2_SQL_Scripts/**  
  A collection of SQL scripts that are organized by challenge level. These scripts are designed to:
  - Give you practical experience with database management systems.
  - Gradually increase the complexity of tasks to build your confidence in running SQL queries.
